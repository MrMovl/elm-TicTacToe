I made / had to make this simple Tic Tac Toe the other day, and I used jQuery and js for the initial version. Afterwards I couldn't help myself and recreate it using elm, so here we go :)

Possible Improvements:
+ add missing win conditions
+ ~~prettier win screen~~
+ code should become a little prettier, especially the view
+ add draw screen

To deploy: `npm start`
